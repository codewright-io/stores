# Code Wright Stores
	
A library that provides an abstraction over a set of storage providers that allow your application, or users of your application choose where they store their data.

The current set of storage providers are:
- Github Repository (via Github Apps)
- A database (via Entity Framework)
- Browser local-storage (via Blazor) : To provide browser caching
- A HTTP client & server interface, to provide a consistent interface

Other future providers might include:
- Other git providers (Gitlab, bitbucket, etc...)
- Standard git
- Google Drive
- Cloud providers (S3, Azure Blob, etc...)
